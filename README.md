Personal Budget Management

The application will manage budget categories like food, entertainment, utilities, etc., ensuring that budget details remain private and are accessed or modified through public methods.

Simply name a category and set your budget.
Then add expenses. 
Then the program will display your remaining balance per category.

Example codes are:
food_category = BudgetCategory("Food", 500)
food_category.add_expense(100)
food_category.display_category_summary()
